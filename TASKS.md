- Working implementation verified

### 3. [COMPLETED] ~~Text Tool~~

- Zoom methods: Ctrl+Wheel (toward cursor), +/- buttons, slider
- Pan: Space + drag (hand cursor)
- UI: Zoom level display, Fit to Screen, Reset (100%)
- All drawing tools work accurately at any zoom level
- Hybrid CSS transform + coordinate mapping architecture
- GPU-accelerated, smooth performance

### 6. [COMPLETED] ~~Layer Support~~
**Status:** ✅ Completed (2026-01-13)
**Effort:** Very High (16+ hours)
**Value:** High for advanced users
**Scope:**
- Multiple canvas layers (up to 20 layers)
- Layer visibility toggle
- Layer opacity control (0-100%)
- Layer reordering (move up/down buttons)
- Merge down & flatten all operations
- Layer panel UI with thumbnails
- Major architecture refactor (off-screen layer canvases + compositing)
- History system adapted for multi-layer snapshots
- All drawing tools work on active layer

## Known Issues / Tech Debt
- History size reduced to 10 snapshots (from 50) due to multi-layer memory usage
- Layer thumbnails update on commit only (not real-time)
- Visibility/opacity changes don't create history entries (by design)
- No layer naming UI (uses default "Layer N" names)
- No drag-drop layer reordering (uses up/down buttons)

## Notes
- All tasks assume Vanilla JS only, no frameworks
- Performance target: smooth on 800x600 canvas
- Must maintain undo/redo compatibility
- Live Server verification required before merge to main
